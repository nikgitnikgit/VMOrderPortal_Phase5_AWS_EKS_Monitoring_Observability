"""Every plugin-provided step or option used in a pipeline must be installed.

Jenkins only discovers this at build time: the Jenkinsfile parses fine locally,
the job is created fine, and the build dies with
"Invalid option type" or "No such DSL method" on first run.

Real instance: `timestamps()` requires the timestamper plugin, which was not in
installPlugins. Branch indexing succeeded, the build was scheduled, and it
failed in under a second with no agent pod ever created.
