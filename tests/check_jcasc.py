"""Guard against ConfiguratorConflictException.

The Jenkins chart generates its own JCasC config from controller.* values.
Any custom configScript that sets the same jenkins.* key makes JCasC merge
two sources, find a conflict, and refuse to boot. This checks that:
  1. every configScript is valid YAML
  2. no jenkins.* key is defined by two different scripts
  3. no chart-owned key appears in a custom script at all
