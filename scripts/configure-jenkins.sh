# IP restriction on the Ingress.
#
# Two modes:
#   (default)      apply the configuration to a running Jenkins via helm upgrade
#   --print-file   write the overrides to a temp file and print its path, for
#                  install-jenkins.sh to pass to its own helm invocation
#
# Everything here comes from Terraform outputs or is detected at run time.
# Nothing environment-specific is committed to Git.
#
# Why generated overrides rather than `helm --set`: Helm's --set parser splits
# on commas and mangles multi-line YAML, which the JCasC blocks are full of.
# A real values file does not have that problem.

# from this. jq is present in the agent image (see jenkins/agent-tools).
# AUDIT FIX -- `tr -d '[]" '` does not delete NEWLINES, and `terraform output
# -json` pretty-prints a list across several lines. The value therefore kept its
# embedded newlines, and the heredoc below emitted a multi-line double-quoted
# YAML scalar, which YAML folds to " 10.0.101.0/24, 10.0.102.0/24" -- a leading
# space and a space after every comma. Jenkinsfile-cd builds a Helm {a,b} list
# from it, so the NetworkPolicy got CIDR values with spaces in them and the API
# server rejected the backend->RDS egress rule. The comment above already said
