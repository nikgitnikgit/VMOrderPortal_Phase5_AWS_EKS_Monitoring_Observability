# scripts/create-cert.sh
#
# Creates a self-signed certificate and imports it into ACM so an ALB can serve
# HTTPS. Prints the certificate ARN on stdout (and nothing else, so it can be
# captured by the caller).
#
# USAGE
#   ./scripts/create-cert.sh                      # jenkins-ui (default)
#   ./scripts/create-cert.sh --purpose app        # the application ALB
#
# WHY SELF-SIGNED: an ALB can only terminate TLS with an ACM certificate, and a
# publicly trusted ACM certificate requires a domain name you control. This
# project has no domain, so we generate one and import it. The result is a real
# TLS 1.3 listener with real encryption; the only difference from a public
# certificate is that browsers cannot verify the issuer, so they warn once.
# Registering a domain (~$12/year) would remove the warning; that is a cost
# decision, not a technical limitation, and is documented in the README.
#
# WHY TWO CERTIFICATES RATHER THAN ONE
#   Jenkins and the application have different audiences and different risk.
#   Jenkins is the admin plane — restricted to one operator IP, holding cluster
#   access. The application is on the public internet. Sharing a private key
#   between them means compromising either context compromises both, and it
#   couples their rotation schedules for no benefit.
#
#   It also leaves room to move: if a domain is registered later, the app can
#   take a publicly trusted certificate while Jenkins keeps a self-signed one,
#   with no untangling.
#
# Idempotent: reuses the existing certificate for the given purpose.
