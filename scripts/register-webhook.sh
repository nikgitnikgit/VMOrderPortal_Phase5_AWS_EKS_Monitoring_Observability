#
# Registers (or updates) a GitHub webhook pointing at this cluster's Jenkins,
# so a push to main triggers the CI pipeline automatically.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the cluster is destroyed and rebuilt on every cycle, so the
# ALB hostname changes each time and a webhook configured by hand goes stale.
# This script deletes any previous hook for this repository and creates a new
# one with the current URL, which makes the webhook survive a rebuild.
#
# The GitHub token is read from the environment or ~/.github_token and is
# never written to Git, Terraform state or the Jenkins configuration.
#
#   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx        # or: echo ghp_xxx > ~/.github_token
#   ./scripts/register-webhook.sh
#
# Required token scope: `admin:repo_hook` (a fine-grained token needs
# "Webhooks: read and write" on this repository only).

# delivered, and CI quietly ran off the 5-minute poll instead. Creating a hook
# in GitHub proves nothing about whether it can be delivered.
#
# RETRIED, not tested once. deploy.sh creates the ALB in step 2 and calls this
# in step 4, minutes later -- but a brand-new ALB is not ready to accept traffic
# the moment it exists: it has to reach "active", register the controller as a
# healthy target, and have its DNS name propagate. Testing immediately reported
# connection_error on a webhook that was perfectly fine thirty seconds later.
#
# This is the same cold-ALB behaviour the CD smoke test already waits out. One
# shot here turned a transient condition into a hard failure, and because
# deploy.sh runs under `set -e`, that failure aborted the whole deploy before
# verify-jenkins.sh ever ran.
