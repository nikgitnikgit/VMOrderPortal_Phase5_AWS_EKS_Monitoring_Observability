"""Gunicorn configuration for the backend API.

REVIEW FIX 3.4 — replaces Flask's development server (app.run), which is
single-threaded, prints a production warning into the pod log on every start,
and is explicitly not intended to face traffic.

The reason this file exists rather than a longer CMD line: init_db() used to
run inside app.py's `if __name__ == "__main__"` block. Gunicorn IMPORTS the
module instead of executing it, so that block never runs and the table would
never be created. on_starting() below runs in the MASTER process before any
worker forks, so the schema is created exactly once per pod regardless of the
worker count.
