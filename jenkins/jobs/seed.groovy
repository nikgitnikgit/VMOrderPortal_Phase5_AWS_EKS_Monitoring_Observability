// jenkins/jobs/seed.groovy — the two jobs, defined as code.
//
// Rendered into the JCasC `jobs:` block by scripts/configure-jenkins.sh and
// applied by the job-dsl plugin at startup. Neither job is ever created
// through the Jenkins UI: destroy the cluster, rebuild it, and both jobs
// reappear identically.
//
// __GITHUB_REPO_URL__ is substituted by scripts/configure-jenkins.sh from
// `terraform output github_repo_url`, so a second contributor points at their
// own fork without editing this file.
//
// It is NOT read with System.getenv(). JCasC globalNodeProperties sets Jenkins
// BUILD environment variables, which are injected into agent processes; they
// are not part of the controller JVM's process environment. System.getenv()
// therefore returns null here, the job is created with an empty remote, and
// branch indexing fails with "Cannot parse Git URI-ish: The uri was empty".
